### How did you get here?

I am the type of person who gets the same satisfaction from building IKEA furniture as they once did building LEGO kits. If I had to define myself simply, I would say that I like building things and fixing stuff. Always have. Software engineering happens to be a fantastic way to get paid to do that! This took me some time to figure out, however. I probably wrote my first line of (horrible, no good, very bad) Java code around age 22.

Before earning a degree in computer science from the University of Pittsburgh and launching myself into a software career, I studied sustainability and political science at Dickinson College. That led to working on an organic farm, serving as a sustainability fellow with the Student Conservation Association, and later joining [Construction Junction](https://www.cjreuse.org/) in their mission to keep building materials out of landfills. In my senior year, I used [geospatial analysis tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS) for problems like predicting wildfires, predicting the best spot in town to start a new bar, and tracking land-use change over time. This was the lightbulb that first drew my attention to software as a tool that could "build things and fix stuff".

After completing my first degree, I starting teaching myself Java via [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java), read John MacCormick's book on [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Algorithms_That_Changed_the_Future), watched *The Imitation Game*, and generally geeked out about the potential of applying computer science to conservation. Eventually this hobby would turn into a career path and I began C.S. night classes at Pitt, partially on a scholarship awarded by AmeriCorps for my work in the Student Conservation Association. After a year or so of this, I got tired of trying to stay awake for my algorithms lectures at 8 p.m. and decided it was time commit to school full-time. Someday I'll write a blog post about choosing between a second bachelor's / master's / code bootcamp, but the short version is that it came to down to wanting a solid computer science foundation, in a reasonable amount of time, and as someone without a solid academic background in the sciences.

Most recently, I worked at PNC numo as an intern and contractor developing backend distributed systems, deploying a test pipeline for a backend API, and building a test framework for indi, a mobile banking app. I'm excited to see the product take off and it was a privilege to work with everyone there.

### Where are you now?

Pittsburgh. I graduated from Pitt in August of 2020. Haven't even gotten my diploma yet (it's in the mail). Before \*gestures broadly at everything\* I was planning to do a third and final internship in the Summer, take classes in the Fall, and graduate in December of 2020. At the end of a carefully orchestrated career pivot that was going smoothly enough, COVID scrapped that third internship, forcing me to improvise my way to the finish line, completing my degree four months early. I'm far from done learning new things, though.

I'll be taking advantage of this surprise window of free time to work through my own personal syllabus of topics that weren't covered in my computer science degree, contribute to my favorite open source project, the [Pittsburgh City Scrapers](https://github.com/pgh-public-meetings/city-scrapers-pitt), and explore my next steps as an engineer.

### What do you do besides work?

I really do love coding. It's a hobby that turned into a job. But when I'm not coding, I compose and perform music with various bands (guitar / bass / synthesizer), research the Pittsburgh taco scene, and enjoy endurance running along the South Side trail and Emerald View Park.

### Tabs or spaces?
Tabs.
