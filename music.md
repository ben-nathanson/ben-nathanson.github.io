# Yeti Bite
---
The concept behind Yeti Bite was to merge aspects of funk, psychedelia, and beach rock. We had the opportunity to play all the usual Pittsburgh digs (James Street, Mr. Smalls, Stage AE) as well as random house parties and [Barnaroo at The Farm](https://www.facebook.com/Barnarooatthefarm/). Here's a sampling of how that turned out:
