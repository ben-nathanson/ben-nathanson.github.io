title: Hire Me
subtitle: I'm currently exploring my next steps as an engineer!
---

I am a recent college graduate with practical experience developing backend systems (AWS/Python, primarily) and deploying automated test pipelines (from mobile integration testing to backend end-to-end testing).

I have enjoyed a varied career, spanning environments from a tiny start-up to a Fortune 500 bank to a non-profit open-source project. Looking forward to finding a test engineer or backend role!

Currently I work remotely out of Pittsburgh, but would be happy to relocate within the United States.
