<p>I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.stavvy.com">Stavvy</a> with practical experience developing backend systems (AWS/Python, in particular) and deploying automated test pipelines (from mobile integration testing to backend end-to-end testing).</p>

<p>I have enjoyed a varied career, spanning environments from an organic farm to a tiny start-up to a Fortune 500 bank to an open-source civic journalism project. </p>
