subtitle: New Grad Software Engineer Exploring His Next Steps
---

<p>I am a recent (August 2020) college graduate with practical experience developing backend systems (AWS/Python, primarily) and deploying automated test pipelines (from mobile integration testing to backend end-to-end testing).</p>

<p>I have enjoyed a varied career, spanning environments from an organic farm to a tiny start-up to a Fortune 500 bank to an open-source civic journalism project. I'm looking forward to finding a test engineer or backend role!</p>

<p>Currently I work remotely out of Pittsburgh, but would be happy to relocate within the United States.</p>
